## 📂 Projects 
Project Title: **Customer Churn Analysis Using Power BI**

📝 Objective:
To analyze customer churn behavior using interactive visuals, helping stakeholders understand key factors affecting customer retention and attrition. The dashboard presents insights based on customer activity status, credit behavior, geographical data, and churn trends over time.

📊 Dashboard Overview:
The project is divided into two main report pages:

📍 Page 1: Homepage – Customer Churn Summary
This page provides an at-a-glance overview of customer activity and churn across different dimensions.

🔹 Key KPIs (Top Summary Cards):
Total Customers: 10,000
Active Customers: 5,151
Inactive Customers: 4,849
Credit Card Holders: 7,055
Non-Credit Card Holders: 2,945
Exit Customers (Churned): 2,037
Retained Customers: 7,963

These numbers help quickly evaluate the distribution of customer engagement and retention.

🔹 Filters:
Slicers on the left allow dynamic filtering by:

Year
Month Name
Geography Location
Active Category
Exit Category
Gender Category
These enable users to drill down into specific segments.

🔹 Visuals:
Bar Chart – Total Customers by Year and Active Category:

Compares active vs inactive members annually (2016–2019).
Shows customer base growth and retention patterns.
Line Chart – Exit Customers by Month:
Plots both current and previous month’s exit customers.
Identifies churn spikes (e.g., Nov had highest churn: 307; Feb had lowest: 58).
Text insights explain trends and variances (e.g., 277 more exits in Nov compared to Oct).
Bar Chart – Exit Customers by Credit Type:
Shows churn rate by credit score (e.g., highest exits in “Fair” and “Poor” segments).
Useful for targeting financial products and credit-risk strategies.
Pie Chart – Exit Customers by Category:
Majority (69.91%) of exits are credit card holders, suggesting a potential issue or opportunity in that segment.

📍 Page 2: Churn % by Month and Geography
This page focuses on monthly churn trends and customer distribution across geographies.

🔹 Matrix – Churn % by Year and Month:
Displays churn rate as a percentage from 2016 to 2019.

Shows seasonal trends and yearly variations.

Visual indicators (e.g., triangle, circle) enhance readability.

Key Insights:

Highest churn in 2017 (22.35% total).
2019 had the lowest churn rate (19.86%).

🔹 Pie Chart – Total Customers by Geography:

France: 50.14% (5,000 customers)
Germany: 25.09% (3,000 customers)
Spain: 24.77% (2,000 customers)

This helps identify where most customers are located and can be used to localize churn-reduction strategies.
